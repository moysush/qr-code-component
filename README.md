### What I learned

- Using 100vh will select the 100% of the viewport and it enabled me to center the element on the page along with flexbox. Setting height to min-height will not cut off the height on smaller screen.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

```
